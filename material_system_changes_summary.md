## Data Model Changes

The material system data model has been updated to include the following new fields:

### Roadmap Task JSON Example
```json
{
  "task": "Material Certification",
  "startDate": "2025-07-01",
  "endDate": "2025-09-30",
  "status": "Complete",
  "fundingType": "Division IRAD",
  "floatOnRoadmap": true,
  "floatDate": "2025-03-11",
  "additionalDetails": "This task involves certifying the material for aerospace applications."
}
```

### Milestone JSON Example
```json
{
  "name": "Material Qualification Complete",
  "date": "2025-09-30",
  "description": "Final qualification milestone",
  "floatOnRoadmap": true,
  "floatDate": "2025-03-11",
  "additionalDetails": "This milestone marks the completion of all qualification activities."
}
```

## Implementation Details

The changes were implemented in the `roadmap_manager/models/material.py` file, specifically in the following sections:

1. **Task Entry UI** - Updated the `add_task_entry` function to include the new fields and functionality
2. **Milestone Entry UI** - Updated the `add_milestone_entry` function to include the new fields and functionality
3. **Data Collection** - Enhanced the `save_material` function to collect and process the new fields

## Testing

The changes have been tested and verified to work correctly. The application successfully:
- Displays the new UI elements
- Collects and saves the new data fields
- Implements the floating functionality for tasks and milestones

## Next Steps

These changes ensure that the Material System roadmap implementation is consistent with the Product roadmap implementation, providing a unified user experience across the application.
