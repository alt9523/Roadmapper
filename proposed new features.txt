Timeline visualization showing TRL/MRL progression over time
Current maturity level dashboard with visual indicators
Gap analysis between current and required maturity levels
2. Program-Product-Task Timeline Integration
Integrated timeline showing program need dates alongside product and task schedules
Critical path visualization for tasks leading to program milestones
Risk indicators for tasks that may impact program deadlines
3. Relationship Network Analysis
Advanced network graph with centrality metrics to identify critical nodes

4. Progress Tracking Dashboard

Let's start implementing these features one by one. Would you like me to begin with the TRL/MRL maturity tracking module first?
